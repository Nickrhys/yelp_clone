YELP CLONE
==========

My first Ruby on Rails project at Makers Academy was to create a version of Yelp, which allowed users to log in (via password or through Facebook or Twitter) to upload restaurant names, descriptions and images. Other users are able to review these restaurants. Reviews can be endorse by other users still, if found useful.
